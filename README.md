## Installation

The first step was learning how to install Python and a text editor for coding.

## Why Learn Programming?

In this section, we explored the significance of learning programming and delved into the fundamental aspects associated with it.

## Variables, Expressions, and Statements

I will learn how to create variables and store data in them. I'll get to gain knowledge on expressions and statements in Python.

## Conditional Execution

I'll discover how Python executes specific statements based on certain conditions, allowing my programs to make decisions.

## Functions

I get introduced to functions and their role in storing reusable pieces of code, making my programs modular and efficient.

## Loops and Iterations

I learn how to utilize loops and iteration structures in Python to repeat statements and perform iterative tasks.

## Working with Strings

I'll get to explore how Python handles textual data, including storing, manipulating, and performing operations on strings.

## File Handling

The lesson is about mastering the art of opening and reading data files on my computer using Python, enabling me to work with external data.

## Lists

I get to understand Python's versatile data structure, the list, which allows me to store multiple items in a single variable.

## Dictionaries

I get to discover the power of dictionaries, a data structure that stores values associated with unique keys, enabling efficient data lookup.

## Tuples

I'll acquire knowledge on tuples, a lightweight data structure similar to lists but with immutability characteristics.

## Regular Expressions

I get to unlock the potential of regular expressions, a powerful tool for searching patterns in strings and extracting data.

## Network Programming

I take a quick dive into network programming using Python, understanding how data flows across networks and how to interact with it.

## Using Web Services

I get to explore the world of web services, learning how to access data from remote servers and integrate it into my Python programs.

## Object-Oriented Programming

I get introduced to object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python, allowing me to build reusable and modular code structures.

## Databases

I get to learn about databases and their role in storing and retrieving vast amounts of data efficiently.I also get to dive into the Structured Query Language (SQL) for managing data.

## Data Visualization

In this section, i'll discover how to scrape data from the web, store it in a database, and visualize it in-browser using Python.

Feel free to join me in this adventurous.
